Good morning, and thank you for inviting me today. My name is Vishnu P, and I hail from Calicut. I’m a BCA graduate and a certified penetration tester with a deep passion for cybersecurity. To advance my practical skills, I joined Brototype, a 7-month self-learning platform, where I developed expertise in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment. I’m currently focusing on learning DevSecOps to further my ability to create secure systems. As someone who learns quickly and stays updated with the latest cybersecurity trends, I’m eager to launch my career in this field, tackle new challenges, and contribute to building secure digital environments. I’m truly grateful for the chance to interview for this position and excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.
