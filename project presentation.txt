**1. Story – Story about the Project:**
As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I wanted to work on a simple yet impactful project that connects development and security. So, I planned a future **DevSecOps project** where security is built into the development process from the start. The main goal is to create a basic CI/CD pipeline that includes automatic security checks, making sure that code is not only working but also safe.



**2. Stack – Technical Things:**
I plan to use **GitHub Actions** for automation, **Docker** for containerization, and tools like **SonarQube** for code quality checks. For security, I’ll use **OWASP Dependency-Check** for scanning vulnerabilities in libraries and **Trivy** for scanning Docker images. **VS Code** will be my development environment.


**3. Why – Reason for the Stack:**
I chose this stack because it’s lightweight, easy to use for solo developers, and has good community support. GitHub Actions is free and works well for personal projects, and the security tools I picked are open-source and easy to integrate without needing advanced setups.



**4. Features – Additional Features Rather Than the Common Thing:**
Instead of just doing basic code testing, I’m adding features like **automated security scanning**, **Docker image scanning**, and **alerts for outdated or risky packages**. I also plan to include **a simple dashboard** to show scan results clearly, which is something most basic pipelines don’t have.



**5. Challenges – Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned:**
One challenge I expect is dealing with **false positives** in vulnerability scans and making sure the pipeline doesn’t become too slow. From past experience, I’ve learned that **finding the right balance between security and speed is important**, and testing everything in small steps helps avoid major issues later.



6. Future – Extra Things to Add:**
In the future, I want to add features like **email alerts**, **basic role-based access**, and maybe even **a small web portal** to manage reports. I also hope to try **AI-based tools** that can suggest fixes for security problems automatically.


As someone with a strong interest in cybersecurity, I’ve designed a future solo project that focuses on applying DevSecOps practices to create a secure, automated development pipeline. The goal is to build a basic but effective CI/CD setup where security is integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle, rather than added at the end. I plan to use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automation, Docker for containerization, and SonarQube for code quality analysis. For security, I’ll include tools like OWASP Dependency-Check for scanning third-party libraries and Trivy for Docker image vulnerability scanning. This stack was chosen because it’s open-source, lightweight, and well-suited for solo developers like me, offering powerful features without needing complex infrastructure. What makes this project different is that it won’t just focus on automating code builds—it will also include automated security scanning, real-time vulnerability reporting, and a simple dashboard to visualize risks and issues clearly. One of the key challenges I expect to face is handling false positives from security tools and making sure that the security steps do not slow down the pipeline too much. From my past experience, I’ve learned that gradual integration and continuous testing are essential to building reliable and secure pipelines. In the future, I plan to expand this project by adding features like email alerts, role-based access controls, a basic web interface for managing scan reports, and possibly exploring AI-driven tools that can suggest fixes or flag unusual activity in the codebase. This project reflects my aim to make security practical, automated, and an everyday part of the development process—even in solo or small-team environments.
